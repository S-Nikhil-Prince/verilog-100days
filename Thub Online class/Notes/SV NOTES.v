System Verilog SV:
------------------
âŒ‚  In order to learn SV, these are the things that you should learn from verilog.

    It is an extension to Verilog.
    *from verilog we should know design and verification.
    *functions and tasks from verilog.
    *arrays and vectors concept.
    *Testbench and testcase.
    *verilog operators and Data Types.
    *Grip on any simulation tool(EDA Playground).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
    function name (input, output, inout);
        //function body
    endfunction
Example 1 :
    function int add(int a, int b);
        return a + b;
    endfunction
    initial begin
        int result;
        int c = add(5, 10);
        $display("Result: %d",c);
    end

^.^ Example 2: Adding arr[5:0]'s;
    function sum(a,b);
        return=a+b;
    endfuntion
    for(i=0,i<=5;i=i+1);
        sum(arr1[i],arr2[i]);
        arr3[i]=sum(a,b);
    for(i=0,i<=5,i++);
        print()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARRAYS AND VECTORS:
    Array:
        *An array is a collection of elements of the same data type.
        *Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional.
        *Arrays can be declared using the following syntax:
            data_type array_name [size];
        *Example:
            int my_array[10]; // One-dimensional array of integers
            int my_2d_array[5][5];
    Vector:
        *A vector is a special type of array that can hold a fixed number of bits.
        *Vectors are declared using the following syntax:
            data_type [size] vector_name;
        *Example:
            logic [7:0] my_vector; // 8-bit vector
            logic [3:0] my_vector[5]; // 4-bit vector with 5 elements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New operator in sv {inside}
    if(a inside inta[0:5],b,c);
        $display("a is inside the range");
    else
        $display("a is not inside the range");
    end
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is SV?
 *SystemVerilog is an extension of Verilog that adds new features and capabilities to the language. It is designed to improve the design and verification of digital systems, making it easier to create complex designs and verify their correctness.
 *It is both HDL(Hardware Description Language) and HDVL(Hardware Design Verification Language).
 *It is effecient for Verification.
 *code reusability is there.
 *supports OOPS(Object Oriented Programming).
 *SV gives Compact code.
 *Contains User defined data types.
What is the role of functional verification engineer?
    *He verifies weather the function it was intended to perform is being performed without errors or Not.
    *He Designs the testbench.
What is the role of functional verification?
    *to verify the functionality of the design.
    *to verify the design against the specifications.

** INTERPROCESS SYNCHRONIZATION \\
    *Interprocess synchronization is a mechanism that allows multiple processes to coordinate their execution and share resources.
    *It is used to ensure that processes do not interfere with each other and can work together effectively.
    *In SystemVerilog, interprocess synchronization can be achieved using semaphores, mailboxes, and events.
    *These constructs allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions, ensuring that they operate correctly in a concurrent environment.

**What is a process.
    *A process is a sequence of statements that execute in a specific order.
    *In SystemVerilog, processes are typically defined using the `always` or `initial` blocks.

SV defines the following states of aprocess:
    finished
    running
    suspended
    killed/terminated
example:
```systemverilog
initail begin
   begin:p1//process 1
         //process 1 statements
    end:p1
    begin:p2//process 2
            //process 2 statements
     end:p2
end


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SV TB Architecture:**
    *The SystemVerilog Testbench (SV TB) architecture is a structured approach to designing testbenches for verifying digital designs.
    *It consists of several components that work together to generate stimuli, drive inputs to the Design Under Test (DUT), monitor outputs, and check functionality.
    *The main components of the SV TB architecture include:
        - Generator
        - BFM (Bus Functional Model) / Driver
        - Monitor
        - Coverage Block
        - Reference Model
        - Checker
    **These components interact through a mailbox or communication channel to facilitate the flow of data and control signals**

To Generator:
    Generate Scenario/ Stimulus / Test Vectors/ Transactions.
    Give Those Scenarios / Transaction to the BFM / Drive Through Mailbox.
    Get the Response transaction from the Driver / Bfm if needed.

BFM / Driver:
    Get the Transaction from the Generator through Mailbox
    Drives Those Transactions to the DUT through interterface.
    Collect the Response from the DUT through intrerface.
    Give the Resonse back to the Generator.

Monitor:
    Monitors the Interface Transactions.
    Collect the Transaction when transfer is Valid.
    Give the Transactions to the Functional Coverage and Reference Model.

Coverage Block:
    Gets Transaction from Manitor.
    Trigger the Covergruop sampling whenever transaction Completed.

Reference Model:
    Get the Transaction from the Monitor.
    Update the Register Model with Recent transaction from the monitor
    Use the Register Model Programming get the Expected output.
    Prove the Expected Output to the Checker.

Checker:
    Get the Expected Output From the Reference model.
    Get the Actual output from Design interface Monitor.
Compare Transactions from the reference model and Monitor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. BFM can not Drive a transaction unless Generator gives the Transaction ?
    Ans: This is called Process Dependency.

Q. BFM Can't proceed unless Generator gives the Transaction ?
    Ans: There is a need of Synchronization between the Generator and BFM.
        *** For this kind of Synchronization we use Mailbox.

Mailbox: (Generator and BFM) / (Monitor and Scoreboard)
    => Mailbox is Dynamic Construct. Hence it needs New() for memory allocation.
    => Mailbox memory can be increased / Decreased / Delete at Run time.
    => Mailbox behaviour is similar to FIFO.
    => Mailbox Brings Blocking Nature in between the Communicating Devices (Generator and BFM).
Q. Why Queue can't be used for Connecting Generator and BFM.
    Ans: Queue is also a FIFO.
    => But Queue is not a Blocking Construct.

*so Mailbox is used for communication between Generator and BFM.
    Mailbox is Unidirectiional.

--Mailbox Types:__
    1.Blocking Mailbox:
        -> {put(),get(),peek()}--> Tasks [These are executed at non zero time ]

    2.Non Blocking Mailbox:
        -> {try_put(),try_get(),try_peek()}--> Functions [These are executed at zero time]

--> get()---> wait until data is available and get data drom the mailbox.
--> put()---> wait until space is available and put data into the mailbox.
--> peek()---> wait until data is available and get data from the mailbox without removing it.

--> try_get()---> dosent wait until data is available and returns null if no data is available.
--> try_put()---> dosent wait until space is available and returns 0 if no space is available.
--> try_peek()---> dosent wait until data is available and returns null if no data is available
         
    ---> try() functions are used to avoid blocking nature of mailbox.
            *These functions return 0 or null if the operation cannot be completed immediately.
            *They are useful when you want to check the status of the mailbox without blocking the execution of your code.

**********
    1.Gneric Mailbox:
        *It can get or put any type of data.
        *It is created using the `new()` method without any type parameter.
          Syntax:
                mailbox <mailbox name>;
        *Example:
            mailbox m = new();
            m.put(42); // Putting an integer
            m.put("Hello"); // Putting a string
            int data = m.get(); // Getting data from the mailbox

    2.Parametric Mailbox:
        *It can get or put only a specific type of data.
        *It is created using the `new()` method with a type parameter.
         Syntax:
                mail box #<data type> <name> = new();
        *Example:
            mailbox #int m = new(); // Typed mailbox for integers
            m.put(42); // Putting an integer
            int data = m.get(); // Getting data from the mailbox
            // m.put("Hello"); // This will cause a compile-time error
*********
--based on size--

    1.Bounded Mailbox:
        *It has a fixed size and can hold a limited number of messages.
        *It is created using the `new()` method with a size parameter.
          Syntax:
                mailbox #<data type> <name> = new(<size>);
        *Example:
            mailbox #int m = new(10); // Bounded mailbox for integers with size 10
            m.put(42); // Putting an integer
            int data = m.get(); // Getting data from the mailbox
            // If the mailbox is full, put() will block until space is available

    2.Unbounded Mailbox:
        *It can grow dynamically and has no fixed size.
        *It is created using the `new()` method without a size parameter.
          Syntax:
                mailbox #<data type> <name> = new();
        *Example:
            mailbox #int m = new(); // Unbounded mailbox for integers
            m.put(42); // Putting an integer
            int data = m.get(); // Getting data from the mailbox
            // The mailbox can grow as needed
//this is typed in my mobile. just checkingðŸ˜œ
